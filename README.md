# MSc_internship

Here, I present the script to calculate the half-hourly footprints of the eddy covariance tower in Majadas, used for the research conducted during an internship at Universidad de Extremadura, Spain. The script returns a dataset with, for every measurement, the tree canopy fraction and the tree density in the footprint.

The .Rmd file contains the script itself and can be opened and executed in R. The .html file is a readable version of the script, that cannot be executed.
